## 🔑 API Configuration

FoodRoller uses [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch recipe data.

### Free API Limitations

The app currently uses the **free API tier** (test key: "1"), which has the following limitations:
- ✅ Random meal lookup
- ✅ Filter by single category
- ✅ Full meal details by ID (ingredients, instructions, category, cuisine, tags)
- ❌ **No multi-category filtering** (Premium only)
- ❌ No multi-ingredient filtering (Premium only)
- ❌ **No cooking/prep time data** (not available in free tier)

### Category Filtering Workaround

Since the free API doesn't support filtering by multiple categories in a single request, we've implemented a workaround:

1. When you select multiple categories in the sidebar, the app **picks one random category** from your selection
2. It then fetches a random meal from that chosen category
3. This gives variety while respecting your category preferences

**Example:** If you select "Beef", "Chicken", and "Seafood":
- The app randomly picks one (e.g., "Chicken")
- Fetches a random chicken recipe
- Next roll might pick "Seafood" instead

### Upgrading to Premium API

To get true multi-category filtering and other advanced features:
1. Visit [TheMealDB Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thedatadb) to become a supporter
2. You'll receive an upgraded API key
3. Replace the API key in `src/api/recipes.js`

For more details, see the [API documentation](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

## 🥗 Dietary Restrictions

FoodRoller includes built-in dietary restriction presets to help you find meals that match your dietary preferences.

### Available Presets

- **Vegetarian 🌱**
  - Excludes: Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken, Goat, Seafood
  - Filters out: All meat, poultry, and fish ingredients

- **Vegan 🥗**
  - Excludes: Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken, Goat, Seafood
  - Filters out: All animal products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs, honey)

- **Pescatarian 🐟**
  - Excludes: Beef, Pork, Lamb, Chicken, Goat
  - Filters out: Meat and poultry ingredients (allows seafood and fish)

### How It Works

1. **Category Pre-filtering:** When a dietary restriction is active, incompatible categories are automatically hidden from the category list and excluded from random selection.

2. **Ingredient Validation:** After fetching a meal, the app validates it against the restriction's excluded ingredients list.

3. **Retry Logic:** If a meal doesn't pass validation, the app automatically retries up to 5 times to find a compatible meal.

4. **Client-side Filtering:** Due to free API limitations, validation happens on the client side after fetching meals, rather than through API parameters.

### Usage

1. Click a dietary preset button in the sidebar (Vegetarian, Vegan, or Pescatarian)
2. The button will turn green to indicate it's active
3. Compatible categories will be shown; incompatible ones will be hidden
4. When you roll for meals, only compatible recipes will be selected

**Note:** You can combine dietary restrictions with manual category selection for even more specific filtering.

### Future Enhancements

The dietary restrictions system is designed to be extensible. Future additions may include:
- Gluten-free
- Nut-free
- Dairy-free
- Keto
- Low-carb
- Custom dietary profiles

See [BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md) for planned features.

## 📖 Recipe Catalog/Browse Feature

The Recipe Catalog provides a comprehensive browsing experience for discovering meals before adding them to your plan.

### How It Works

**Two-View System:**
- **My Plan (📅):** Your personal meal plan with date-specific meals (random rolls)
- **Browse Recipes (🔍):** Catalog view showing all available recipes

**API Integration:**
- Uses TheMealDB's `filter.php?c={category}` endpoint to list meals by category
- Free API provides up to 100 recipes per category
- Recipe previews show: name, thumbnail image, and category
- Full details (ingredients, instructions) are fetched when adding to plan

**Filtering:**
- **Category Filter:** Select multiple categories to browse (sidebar checkboxes)
- **Dietary Restrictions:** Click preset buttons to exclude incompatible recipes
- **Combined Filtering:** Both filters work together for precise browsing

**Adding to Plan:**
1. Click "Add to Date" on any recipe card
2. Date picker modal appears
3. Select target date
4. Recipe is added to your meal plan (fetches full details automatically)
5. Automatically switches back to "My Plan" view

**Technical Details:**
- Lazy loading: Only fetches full recipe details when adding to plan
- Client-side filtering for dietary restrictions (validates category)
- Responsive grid layout (auto-adjusts columns based on screen width)
- Hover effects for better user experience

### Workflow Examples

**Example 1: Planned Browse**
1. Switch to "Browse Recipes" tab
2. Select "Seafood" and "Chicken" categories
3. Click "Vegetarian 🌱" to exclude non-vegetarian options → only vegetarian seafood/chicken recipes shown
4. Find a recipe you like, click "Add to Date"
5. Pick tomorrow's date → recipe added to tomorrow in your plan

**Example 2: Quick Discovery**
1. Switch to "Browse Recipes" tab
2. No categories selected → all recipes shown (across all categories)
3. Scroll through catalog, add interesting recipes to different dates
4. Switch back to "My Plan" to see your curated meal plan
